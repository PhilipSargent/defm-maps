1.	Check it's OK if > 40 materials

2.	Swap order of parameters 8/9 10/11 12/13 15/16 to make it easier to do physical checks i.e to set the pre-exp.
	terms AFTER the activation energies so that we can check via the melting point diffusivities.

3.	Amalgamate Variables and Parameters into a single array.

4.	Change to 3-page paginated edits.

5.	Use indirection array to locate current line on editing page.

6.	Keep a lsit of "dirty" (recently changed) lines

7. Option to save as a different material AFTER editing.

8.	Add HoSung's SCREEN PRINT routine from my book as a command-line switch /d ?

9.	Add command line switch to simulate pressing PrtScr anyway - need both in case user has GraphPlus.

10.	Construct a completely NON-GRAPHICAL version, just data handling, as a first step towards a port to the MACINTOSH
under turbo Pascal.  

11.	Chnage from UNIAXIAL to SHEAR stress for all input, output & plots, but allow a shear-stress PLOT option still.

12.	Add REFERENCE STRESS calculation window as in HIP6.

13.	Put back SNdiff check for convergence check for contours.

14.	Make contour the NEXT iteration rather than the PREVIOUS result.

15.	Set visible/invisible contour attributes properly.

16.	Use ASSERTION technique on the BINARY CHOP search.



BUG List 
========

1.	BackSpace goes backwards on ReadStr, goes beyond beginning. Do StringIO check.
